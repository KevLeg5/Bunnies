    Formerly the Archibold Gymnasium now after fifty million dollar renovation is known as the Barnes Center at the Arch. After a five million dollar donation from alumnus and trustee Steven Barnes, the University started on its way to building a one-stop shop for health. The gym consists of anything a college kid could need from a swimming pool to pet therapy. The gym is designed to not only give students an opportunity for physical health but also a place to help with mental health. Overall students will be able to take advantage of countless exercise machines, basketball courts, esport rooms and so much more.

    When you walk down the stairs of the Barnes Center, you are immediately met with a large room with all of the weights you could possibly need. There are modern machines, squat racks, benches, and walls of weights. This room is the perfect place to turn on your headphones and have the best lift you can imagine. Across from the weight room is the floor hockey court, which is frequently active with club and intramural teams. The full-sized court was recently renovated and is in top shape. A total contrast from the court and the weight room is the video game room, a large room filled with computers, monitors, TVs, gaming chairs, and all of the equipment you could possibly need. You can spend hours gaming online or with others right next to you. Another great feature of the basement is the rock climbing wall, friendly to casual or competitive climbers, which offers a unique rock climbing expereince to all students.

    The first floor consists of an abundance of luxuries that any college student would love. Upon entering the building, there is Otto’s Juice Box, a smoothie and snack station with delicious protein and fruit smoothies. After you check in, the first floor consists of plenty of treadmills and other cardio machines, as well as weightlifting machines and free weights. To top it off, the first floor also has a 25 yard swimming pool and a hot tub, for any competitive or casual swimmers. While a little less proficient, the first floor also has incredible locker rooms for men and women, equipped with showers for everyone to clean up after their workouts.

    The Second floor of the Barnes center is filled with treadmills, ellipticals, and plenty of weight machines. This floor has the most options for weight lifting, including many machines for back and leg workouts. Massive windows on both sides allow for plenty of natural light into the gym, making workouts much more enjoyable. At one end of the gym, there is a nice open area for stretching and workouts that don’t require a machine. On the opposite side, there are four open basketball courts. The courts are always active with basketballs provided by the gym, and you can usually play on your own or join in with anyone else playing. The gym has a very positive basketball culture and you can play no matter your skill level. Across the bridge, you can go to the Flanagan Gym which holds three more basketball courts, however there are often badminton nets up to give you more sport options.

    The third and final floor of the Barnes Center is perfect for cardio lovers. While being the smallest floor in the entire gym that does not mean you won’t get your money's worth. The floor consists of a 200-meter indoor track or for you imperial unit lovers ⅛ of a mile. The remainder of the floor contains a couple of cardio machines as well as a small weight-lifting area perfect for a less crowded workout. Finally off in the corner members can find two brand new ping pong tables perfect for some fun games with friends!

    Barnes is an incredible place on campus to workout or do some sort of physical activity with friends, but it also has an incredibly well developed wellness center. This includes things like 24 hour on call support, sexual and relationship violence help, mental and physical health resources (therapists, massage chairs, personal trainers, etc.), a pharmacy with fairly priced drugs and medication, and much more. A personal favorite among the Syracuse students is the dog petting therapy, where students can communicate with each other while they pet emotional support dogs. The Wellness Center is a blessing to have right on campus, and offers so much help for students who are struggling through their college lives, or who just want to relax in a safe space.
